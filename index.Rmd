# Preface {-}

This is a book designed and written to support the Learning Assistant (LA) pedagogy course. First time LAs take this course concurrent with their LA experience. This book is meant to be a resource which can contribute to the course. The book is modular in nature so that pedagogy course instructors can use only those modules that they have included in their version of the course. 

## The Learning Assistant Alliance

This book is based on the Learning Assistant Model (cite Otero) and is a resource for institutions that are part of the Learning Assistant Alliance (https://learningassistantalliance.org/). It is a part of the growing list of resources available to Alliance members.
